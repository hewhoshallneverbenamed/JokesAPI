Jokes API

This is a RESTful API built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy that provides access to a collection of jokes. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete jokes, as well as filter and search for jokes based on various criteria. The API utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and authorization.

Features:

CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete jokes.
Filtering and Searching: Filter jokes by category, rating, or keyword.
Pagination: Efficiently handle large datasets with pagination support.
JWT Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization with JWT.
Installation:

Create a virtual environment:

```Bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Windows: env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Install dependencies:

```Bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard] sqlalchemy psycopg2[binary] alembic python-dotenv passlib[bcrypt] jwt
```

Replace psycopg2[binary] with your database connector if using a different database.
Set up database:

Create a database.
Set environment variables like DATABASE_URL in a .env file to connect to your database.
Apply database migrations:

```Bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Running the API:

```Bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the API development server on http://localhost:8000 (default port).

API Documentation:
The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/docs.

Postman Documentation:
For a more interactive exploration of the API, you can refer to the Postman documentation: https://www.postman.com/kaizenthegreat/my-api-demos/documentation/kag026t/jokes-api

Authentication:
The API utilizes JWT for authentication. You'll need to implement user registration and login endpoints in your frontend or mobile application to obtain JWT tokens. Once a user has a token, they can include it in the Authorization header for authorized requests:

Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
